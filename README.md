# DAT200_CA_2021
My answers to the compulsory assignments in DAT200 (Applied Machine Learning).

All three projects uses visualization and is preprocesed using pandas and/or scikit-learn library. Machine learning algotihms is from the scikit-learn package. CA3 uses more primitive/inefficient methods for machine learning, while CA4 and CA5 uses more built in methods.

## CA3 

Jusing random forest with manual itteration to find best parameters. Binary classification problem

## CA4

Jusing SVC, LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier in different piplines, and using grid search and cross validation to find best parameters. Pipeline containing a scaler, a PCA method (either KPCA or PCA) and a Classifier. Three class problem.

## CA5

Regression problem where I used RandomForestRegressor, a RandomForestRegressor with a PLSRegressionWrapper and XGBoost to train the data. Data trained for maximizing the r^2 score.
